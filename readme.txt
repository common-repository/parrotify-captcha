Parrotify is a revolutionary anti-bot instrument. 

== Description ==

Parrotify represents a mechanism for protection against automatic actions performed by special software (bots), and it is a source of income for your websites as well!
The system has a very simple operation principle: users are shown ads with the text to be entered in the form under the banner; upon typing the message, the users go on with their activities (e. g. complete registration), and you get paid for the advertising if you are the owner of the site publishing our widget. You also get your interest if users click the banner.

You can install the widget without registering at http://www.parrotify.com .
